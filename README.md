The document attached contains the CAN bus message IDs and calibrations for the two vehicles investigated in my undergraduate dissertation, titled 'Analysis of Regenerative Braking and Charging Systems on Electric Vehicles from Experimental CAN Bus Data', at the University of Malta.
The aim of the study was to analyse the regenerative braking strategy, and other aspects related to efficiency, of two battery electric vehicles. All CAN bus message information obtained during the study is provided in the file, in hope that it can fuel and facilitate further research.

A substantial part of the EV CAN message information was obtained from Mr. Daniel Ã–ster (dalathegreat), to whom I am extremely grateful for his contribution to the advancement of EVs and the EV community.
The rest of the CAN bus messages were obtained and calibrated manually using a CAN sniffer and diagnostic tool to send messages.

Should you come across any errors or things that would merit adding, please do contact me and let me know.
